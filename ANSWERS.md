- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
        When you want to use lifecycle hooks. Didrender, didupdate, diddismount
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    Didrender-was the component created(born, render)
    didupdate-did the component update? (rerender)
    diddismount-Did the component die? (cleared from render)
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    too add our own custon functionality to state hooks. Set a state and do something else too and abstract all this info into a hook.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    So we don't release buggy code. We know all things that can happen in our own ecosystem.
